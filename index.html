      <p class="home">  
          <p>Welcome! Thank you for visiting my page! My site is to get to know me both personally and professionally.</p>
          <p>I feel that the balance of person and profession is important for everyone to always consider. 
            Too often in modern society are opinions of a person judged on the basis of their professional profile.
            This is why im trying a different approach. You could call it a non-confirmists conformist approach to
            getting raw and real with teammates and possible employers. I'd like to be seen as more than my profession.
            More than my salary or income and hopefully end up making a good income and finding a wonderful fulfilling
            career, but at the same time feeling that my true self is known to others. I find basic online professional profiles
            and resumes boring and redundant. The need for creative expression is coded in our DNA as humans.
          </p>
          <p> This nonconformist conformist approach is all about incorporating this basic need into 
            the systems cattle-like structure and opening up conversations that surpass job history,
            academic scores and employer references. Of course there is still an outlet for innovation and 
            stimulating conversation within these topics, however my goal with this new approach is to make that outlet easier to 
            attain and more on the forefront of individuals professional profiles.
          </p>
          <p>As I stated above, the need for creative expression is coded in our DNA as humans. This is why I chose
            to begin a journey with software development. I find it incredibly fascinating how decoding the languages of code
            is similar to decoding a persons mind - except with way less complexities due to a computers lack of 
            human senses and emotion. When in a relationship with another person - friendly, familial or romantic - 
            because our minds are so complex and unique, it is inevitable that this relationship will require a great 
            deal of trial and error when it comes to communicating fluidly with eachother. This is where decoding
            the mind comes into play and why I find coding to be an endless journey of possibilities. When communicating 
            with another individual, it's important to understand that they have been through their own unique experiences
            and language forming environments and that just because something you say makes sense to you, it may
            not be received in the same way by the other person. Both parties are going to need to adjust their 
            communication to better understand one another. The whole point in having these relationships is to 
            broaden the minds horizon and bring new ideas, goals, perspectives, understandings, considerations etc... to
            eachother. I find this to be the quintessence of our existance. 
            </p>
            <p>Coding is communication of a similar style.</p>
